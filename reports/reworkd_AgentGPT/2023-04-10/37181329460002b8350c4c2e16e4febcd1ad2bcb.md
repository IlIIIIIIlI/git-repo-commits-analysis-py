## üíÑ Key Code Changes

The commit introduces several changes to the Dialog component and related files. Here is a summary of the changes:

1. The `Dialog` component's properties have been refactored for better reusability and flexibility:
    - Properties `showModal` and `setShowModal` have been replaced with `header`, `children`, `isShown`, `close`, and `footerButton`.
    - The `Dialog`'s structure has been updated to accept a header and children for content, allowing for different content to be passed to the dialog dynamically.

2. The dialog now prevents click events on its content from propagating to the overlay, which would close the dialog.

3. A new `HelpDialog` component has been created, which uses the refactored `Dialog` component to display help information.

4. A new `SettingsDialog` component has been introduced, designed to handle user settings, including a custom OpenAI API key input.

5. The `Input` component's shadow appearance has been slightly reduced from `shadow-2xl` to `shadow-xl`.

6. The `index.tsx` page has been updated:
    - The state and methods related to modal display have been updated to reflect the new dialog components.
    - The `Drawer` component now calls functions to show the help and settings dialogs.

7. The changes also include new file modes for `HelpDialog.tsx` and `SettingsDialog.tsx`, indicating that these are new files added to the codebase.

## üîç Technical Highlights

- **Refactoring for Reusability**: The `Dialog` component has been refactored to make it more flexible and reusable, allowing different headers, contents, and footer buttons to be used as needed.

- **Event Propagation Handling**: The dialog now includes an `onClick` event handler that stops click events from closing the dialog when clicking on the content area.

- **Componentization**: The creation of `HelpDialog` and `SettingsDialog` components showcases a move towards a more component-based architecture, making the code easier to maintain and extend.

- **Custom API Key Handling**: The `SettingsDialog` component is designed to allow users to enter their own OpenAI API key, an important feature for services that need to access third-party APIs with user-provided credentials.

- **UI Polish**: The slight reduction of the shadow effect on the `Input` component suggests a design tweak to reduce visual depth and possibly improve user interface aesthetics.

## üìù Context

These changes seem to be part of a larger effort to improve the user interface and experience of the application by making dialogs more dynamic and user-friendly. The introduction of help and settings dialogs indicates that the application is expanding its features, possibly to better guide users and offer customization options, like the ability to use a personal OpenAI API key. This could be a response to increased user traffic or a proactive measure to enhance the overall functionality of the platform. The commit message implies that these changes are intended to fix certain issues (üêõ) and may be part of a daily iteration, suggesting a development process that includes regular updates and refinements.
