## üîç Technical Highlights

### Array Parsing Update
The commit introduces a significant change in how arrays are parsed within the application. Previously, the application relied on `JSON.parse()` to convert the string data returned by API endpoints into string arrays. The updated code removes the `JSON.parse()` calls and now directly casts the response data to a `string[]` type.

### Extract Array Function
A new utility function `extractArray` is added to the `chain.ts` file. This function is designed to extract arrays from strings using a regular expression that matches an array of strings, considering potential nested arrays. The function uses `JSON.parse()` internally to convert the matched string to a `string[]` type, handling any parsing errors with a try-catch block.

### Error Handling Enhancements
The `extractArray` function includes enhanced error handling, logging errors to the console when the parsing fails or when the input string does not contain an array.

### Refactoring API Endpoints
The commit modifies the API endpoints `/api/chain` and `/api/create` to use the new `extractArray` function instead of directly parsing the response via `JSON.parse()`. This change abstracts the array extraction logic to a single utility function, promoting code reuse and simplifying the endpoint implementations.

### ESLint Disabling Comments
The commit adds or modifies eslint-disable-next-line comments to suppress specific ESLint warnings related to the unsafe use of any type. This indicates a potential area where type safety could be further improved.

## üìù Context

The purpose behind these changes is to centralize and standardize the logic for parsing arrays within the application. By introducing the `extractArray` function, the codebase reduces the duplication of logic and the potential for parsing errors across different parts of the application.

The removal of the `JSON.parse()` call from the API endpoint implementations and the addition of the `extractArray` function suggest that the application is now expecting the API to return data that may not always be in a JSON-compatible array format. It's possible that the application is interfacing with an external service or API that returns data in an inconsistent format, necessitating the need for a more robust parsing solution with error handling capabilities.

The changes also indicate a commitment to improving error handling by providing more detailed console output when errors occur. This can be helpful for debugging and maintaining the application, especially when dealing with external data sources that may have unpredictable outputs.

Overall, the commit aims to improve the application's robustness in handling and parsing array data from API responses, while also making the code more maintainable by reducing redundancy and enhancing error reporting.
