## üîç Technical Highlights
In this commit, we observe a change in the loop threshold condition within the `AutonomousAgent` class logic. The modification is a single-line change, yet it has the potential to affect the behavior of the autonomous agent significantly:

- The condition for the maximum number of loops (`this.numLoops`) the agent is allowed to perform before sending a message and shutting down has been reduced from 30 to 10.
- This change suggests a business or operational requirement to limit the number of iterations the agent performs. It could be a response to performance concerns, a refactored logic that requires fewer iterations, or an adjustment based on real-world usage data.
- There is a call to `this.sendLoopMessage()` followed by `this.shutdown()` once the updated threshold is reached, which implies that the agent is designed to perform a clean-up or notification routine before stopping its operations.

The commit does not indicate whether there are corresponding updates to unit tests or documentation. A change in loop count logic usually warrants an update in related test cases to validate the new behavior under various scenarios.

## üìù Context
The context behind reducing the loop count in the `AutonomousAgent` class is not provided directly within the commit message or the code comments. To understand the rationale behind this change, one might need to:

- Review related issue tickets or feature requests in the project's issue tracking system that might have called for this modification.
- Check the project's documentation for any updated specifications or requirements that prompted this change.
- Discuss with the development team or the individual who made the commit for insights into the decision-making process behind the update. This could reveal whether the change is a result of performance optimization, bug fixes, or a shift in the application's operational parameters.

It's important for the commit to be accompanied by updated documentation and tests to ensure maintainability and clarity of intent, especially for other developers who will interact with this code in the future.
