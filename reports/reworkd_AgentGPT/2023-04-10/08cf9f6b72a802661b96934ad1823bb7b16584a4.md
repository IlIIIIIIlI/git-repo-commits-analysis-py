## üîç Technical Highlights

1. **Custom API Key Support**: The central highlight of this iteration is the introduction of a custom API key feature for the `AutonomousAgent` component. This modification allows users to specify their own API key when creating an instance of the `AutonomousAgent`, which is then used in all API requests. This ensures better customization and flexibility for users to integrate with their preferred API providers or manage their API usage.

2. **API Request Updates**: Correspondingly, all API endpoint handlers (`chain.ts`, `create.ts`, and `execute.ts`) have been updated to accept a `customApiKey` parameter in the request body. The `createModel` function has been introduced to generate a new OpenAI model instance using the custom API key, which is then passed to the respective agent functions (`startGoalAgent`, `executeTaskAgent`, `executeCreateTaskAgent`).

3. **Refactoring and Code Quality Improvements**: The commit includes a refactor where the `isRunning` check has been moved up in the `run` method of `AutonomousAgent.ts` to avoid unnecessary execution when the agent is not running. Additionally, the error message has been updated to provide more clarity and suggest checking the API key as part of troubleshooting.

4. **UI Enhancements**: In `Drawer.tsx`, a new settings icon has been introduced, along with event handlers to manage the visibility of the settings dialog. The `Home` component (`index.tsx`) has been updated to manage the state of the custom API key (`customApiKey`) and to handle the visibility of the help and settings dialogs.

5. **Max Tokens Parameter**: The `createModel` function includes a new parameter `maxTokens` set to `500`, thereby defining a maximum limit for the tokens to be generated by the model in a single response. This could be a move to manage response sizes and ensure consistent performance.

## üìù Context

The changes introduced in this commit are part of a larger effort to enhance the flexibility and customization of the `AutonomousAgent`. By allowing users to input their own API keys, developers can now integrate different API services or manage their API quota efficiently. The changes also demonstrate a commitment to refining user experience both through the backend logic and frontend components, ensuring that the application is both robust and user-friendly.

The addition of a settings dialog in the UI suggests an ongoing development towards more user-centric features, providing end-users with the ability to configure and control application parameters directly from the interface. The technical improvements indicate a thoughtful approach to error handling and preventive checks within the agent's execution flow, which are key to building a resilient and reliable system.

Overall, this commit represents a significant update that not only delivers a new feature but also reinforces the application's architecture and user interface design.
