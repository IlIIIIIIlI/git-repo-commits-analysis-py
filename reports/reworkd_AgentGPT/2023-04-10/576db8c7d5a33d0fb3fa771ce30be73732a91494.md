## üîç Technical Highlights

This commit appears to address a build issue in the application by commenting out a block of problematic code within the `chain.ts` file, which is part of the server's API routers. The affected code is within the `startAgent` public procedure, specifically in the `.mutation` method. 

The original code was attempting to start an agent using the `startGoalAgent` function, which presumably takes a prompt as input and returns a JSON string containing an array of tasks. This JSON string was then being parsed and returned as an array of strings. 

However, with the new changes, the entire logic within the mutation has been commented out, which means the `startAgent` procedure is no longer performing any operations. 

Here are the technical implications and potential reasons for this change:

1. **Build Failure**: The code in question might have been causing a build failure. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as a missing dependency, a syntax error, or a type mismatch. By commenting out the code, the developer is likely attempting to isolate the problem or temporarily bypass a broken feature to allow the build process to succeed.

2. **Feature Deactivation**: It is possible that the `startGoalAgent` function or its dependencies have been deprecated or are known to have critical issues. The developer might have disabled the feature to prevent it from being used until a fix or replacement is ready.

3. **Refactoring**: This change could be part of a larger refactoring effort. The developer might be planning to replace this piece of functionality with a new implementation, and commenting out the code is a temporary measure during the transition.

4. **Debugging**: This could be a temporary measure for debugging purposes. Developers sometimes comment out sections of code to test theories about the source of a bug. In this case, the developer may suspect the `startGoalAgent` function or the subsequent JSON parsing logic to be the culprit.

## üìù Context

The context surrounding this change is not provided within the commit message or the code comments. However, from the commit title, which includes "Fix build issue," it is clear that the commit is intended to address a problem that was preventing the application from building successfully.

Without additional context, it is not possible to determine the exact nature of the build issue or the long-term plan for the commented-out code. Typically, a developer would provide more context in the commit message or associated documentation to explain why the change was necessary and what the next steps are.

The commit message includes a star emoji (‚≠ê), which is often used to denote a significant fix or an important change. This suggests that the build issue being addressed was likely a priority to resolve.

Overall, this commit stops the execution of certain functionality within the `chain.ts` file, which will have direct implications on the application's behavior, particularly related to the `startAgent` API route. Further action will be needed to either restore this functionality or implement an alternative solution, accompanied by a thorough testing strategy to ensure the build remains stable.
