## üîç Technical Highlights

The commit introduces a new file, `LICENSE`, to the repository. It specifies that the GNU General Public License Version 3 (GPLv3) is chosen as the licensing agreement for the project. This is a significant choice for several reasons:

1. **Copyleft License**: The GPLv3 is a strong copyleft license, which means that derivative works of the project must also be distributed under the same license terms. This ensures that the freedoms to use, modify, and share the software (and any adaptations of it) are preserved for all users.

2. **License Compatibility**: By choosing GPLv3, the project is compatible with other projects that use the GPLv3 or later. This can be important for integrating with or using other open-source components within the project.

3. **Patent Grant**: The GPLv3 includes an express grant of patent rights from contributors to users, which helps protect users from patent litigation from contributors to the project.

4. **Protection Against Tivoization**: GPLv3 has terms that prevent "tivoization," which is the practice of creating hardware that uses software licensed under the GPL but is designed to prevent users from running modified versions of the software on that hardware.

5. **Protection Against Anti-Circumvention Laws**: The license includes clauses that protect users from legal penalties for circumventing DRM (Digital Rights Management) in the course of exercising their rights under the license.

6. **Internationalization**: The GPLv3 has provisions that are designed to be enforceable in many different jurisdictions around the world, making it a good choice for projects that are intended for a global user base.

7. **Installation Information Requirement**: For consumer products that include GPLv3-licensed software, the license requires that installation information (such as scripts or authorization keys) be provided so that users can run modified versions of the software on their devices.

8. **Additional Permissions**: The GPLv3 allows for additional permissions, which are terms that may supplement the license by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.

The commit is a clear instantiation of the GPLv3 into the project, and it encompasses all the terms and conditions of the license in a verbatim copy. This is a standard practice for applying the GPL to a project, as it ensures that all recipients of the software know their rights and responsibilities under the license.

## üìù Context

This commit is a foundational step in establishing the legal framework for the distribution and contribution to the project. By including the GPLv3 license, the project maintainers are making a clear statement about the terms under which this software can be used, modified, and shared. It sets the stage for community contributions and the use of the project in other GPL-compatible works. The inclusion of the license is a crucial aspect of open-source project management and signals to potential users and contributors that the project is committed to free and open-source software principles.
