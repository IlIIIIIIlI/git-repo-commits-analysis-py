## 🔍 Technical Highlights

The commit introduces the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3 to the project by adding the `LICENSE` file. Incorporating this license has several technical and practical implications for the use and distribution of the project's code:

1. **Copyleft License:** The GPL is a "copyleft" license, which means that any derivative work must also be distributed under the GPL. This ensures that the freedoms to use, modify, and share the software are preserved for all versions of the program.

2. **Source Code Availability:** The license requires that the source code be made available to recipients of the software. If the software is distributed in object code or executable form, it must either be accompanied by the source code or include a written offer to provide the source code.

3. **Modification and Redistribution:** Users are free to modify and redistribute the software, even for a fee, as long as they also distribute their modifications under the same license.

4. **Patent Rights:** The license includes a provision that prevents licensors from using their patents to make the program proprietary. This ensures that all users have the same freedoms as the original author.

5. **Installation Information:** If the covered work is distributed with User Products, the distributor must also provide "Installation Information" to ensure that the modified software can continue to function after modifications.

6. **Protection Against Anti-Circumvention Laws:** The license prohibits the use of the software as part of any effective technological measure that would restrict the users' rights under the license itself.

7. **No Warranty:** The license explicitly disclaims any warranty, making it clear that the software is provided "as is" without any guarantee of its functionality or performance.

8. **Additional Permissions:** The license allows licensors to add additional permissions to the covered work, provided they are not used to impose further restrictions beyond those the GPL already imposes.

9. **License Continuation:** The rights under the license are irrevocable as long as the user complies with the terms and conditions. However, if a user violates the license, their rights can be terminated.

## 📝 Context

This commit is a foundational step in establishing the legal framework for the project's distribution and use. By choosing the GPL v3, the project maintainers are committing to provide and protect the freedom to use, study, share, and modify the project's software. This choice can have a significant impact on the project's community and ecosystem, as it can both encourage contributions and ensure that the benefits of collaborative development are shared with the wider community.

The inclusion of the license in the project's repository is also a best practice for open source projects, as it clearly communicates the terms under which the software is made available. This can help avoid legal uncertainty for both the maintainers and users of the software.
