  "content": "## \ud83d\udd0d Technical Highlights\n\nThe commit introduces a change to the `chain.ts` file, which is a part of the server API router setup. The specific change made in this commit comments out a block of code within the `startAgent` procedure. Previously, this block was responsible for starting a goal-oriented agent with a given prompt, parsing the response, and returning a list of tasks.\n\nHere are the technical details of the change:\n- The `startAgent` public procedure is designed to take an input object with a `prompt` property of type string.\n- The procedure originally made an asynchronous call to `startGoalAgent`, passing the `prompt` as an argument, and awaited its completion.\n- The response from `startGoalAgent` was expected to be an object with a `text` property containing a JSON string representing an array of tasks.\n- This JSON string was then parsed with `JSON.parse` to convert it into an actual array of strings, which was returned as the tasks.\n\nThe commented-out code indicates that this functionality might be temporarily disabled or is in the process of being refactored or replaced. As a result, the `startAgent` procedure currently does not perform any actions and does not return any tasks.\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd Context\n\nWithout additional information provided in the commit message or accompanying documentation, the exact reasons for disabling this code are not clear. However, here are some possible contexts for such a change:\n- The `startGoalAgent` function may be experiencing issues, such as bugs or performance problems, which necessitated disabling it temporarily.\n- The feature might be under maintenance or in the midst of a redesign, and thus it was commented out to allow the application to build and run without executing this specific part of the code.\n- There might be a shift in the application's requirements or architecture, and this code is being phased out in favor of a new implementation.\n- The commenting out of the code could be part of a debugging process to isolate a problem in the system by removing potential sources of error.\n\nIt is crucial for the team to ensure that this change does not disrupt the overall functionality of the system and that appropriate measures are taken to either restore or replace this functionality in due course. The team should also consider updating the test suite to reflect this change and to prevent regressions in the future.",
