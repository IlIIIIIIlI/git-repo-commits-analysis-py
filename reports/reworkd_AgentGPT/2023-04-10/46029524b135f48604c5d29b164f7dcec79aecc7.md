# AgentGPT Daily Iteration (2023.04.10) - Merge pull request #13 from reworkd/settings

## üíÑ Key Code Changes

### `AutonomousAgent.ts`:
- A `customApiKey` property has been added to the `AutonomousAgent` class to store an API key.
- The `customApiKey` is now passed to the `AutonomousAgent` constructor and stored upon instantiation.
- Error messages in the `run` method now suggest checking the API key if there are issues retrieving the initial tasks array.
- The `getInitialTasks`, `getNextTasks`, and `executeTask` methods have been updated to pass the `customApiKey` to their respective API calls (`/api/chain`, `/api/create`, `/api/execute`).
- The check to stop the agent (`if (!this.isRunning) { ... }`) has been moved up in the execution flow within the `run` method to precede the task length check.

### `ChatWindow.tsx`:
- A new system message has been added to the chat window, prompting the user to provide their own OpenAI API key via the settings tab.

### `Dialog.tsx`:
- The `Dialog` component has been refactored to accept a more flexible set of props, including `header`, `children`, `isShown`, `close`, and an optional `footerButton`.
- It now prevents the dialog from closing when clicking inside the dialog content.

### `Drawer.tsx`:
- The `Drawer` component now includes an additional drawer item for settings, which invokes a new `showSettings` callback prop when clicked.

### `HelpDialog.tsx`:
- A new `HelpDialog` component has been created, encapsulating the welcome message and social media links previously found in the generic `Dialog` component.

### `Input.tsx`:
- The `Input` component's shadow intensity has been slightly reduced (`shadow-2xl` to `shadow-xl`).

### `SettingsDialog.tsx`:
- A new `SettingsDialog` component has been created to allow users to enter their custom OpenAI API key. It includes a save button to persist the key.

### API Endpoints:
- The following API endpoints (`/api/chain`, `/api/create`, `/api/execute`) have been updated to accept a `customApiKey` in their request bodies, which is then used to instantiate a model with the provided API key.

## üîç Technical Highlights

- This update introduces a significant shift in how the application handles API keys. It now requires users to provide their own OpenAI API keys, suggesting a move towards a more sustainable model for API request handling, likely due to increased traffic and usage costs.
- The newly added `customApiKey` field in the `AutonomousAgent` class indicates a more personalized and secure way of making API requests, as each agent will use a key provided by the user rather than a shared or hardcoded key.
- The `HelpDialog` and `SettingsDialog` components represent a UI/UX improvement, making the application more user-friendly by clearly providing information and settings options.
- Refactoring of the `Dialog` component for improved reusability and better event handling (such as preventing accidental closes) reflects an overall enhancement in the application's front-end architecture.
- The update to the `Drawer` component, including a settings option, suggests an expansion of the application's features, potentially paving the way for more user customization in the future.

## üìù Context

The commit introduces a user-provided API key handling feature, which is a common approach in applications interfacing with external services, especially when those services come with usage costs. This change is likely designed to manage the costs associated with the OpenAI API usage by distributing the cost burden to the end-users.

The adjustments to the `AutonomousAgent` class ensure that the agent's behavior can be modified based on the API key's validity and the user's subscription status with OpenAI. This emphasizes the need for error handling and user feedback in applications that rely on third-party services.

Overall, the commit shows a thoughtful approach to improving the application's scalability and user experience while addressing the practical concerns of API management.
