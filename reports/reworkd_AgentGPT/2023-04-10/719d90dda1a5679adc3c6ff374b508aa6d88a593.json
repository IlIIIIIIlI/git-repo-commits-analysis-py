  "content": "## \ud83d\udd0d Technical Highlights\n\nThis commit introduces a new feature to an existing application, which appears to be a web-based project. The primary change is the addition of a Discord link in two separate components within the React-based front-end.\n\n### Drawer Component\n- The `Drawer.tsx` component has been updated to include a new item for Discord.\n- The `FaDiscord` icon from the `react-icons` library is imported and added to the list of icons in the drawer menu.\n- A new `DrawerItem` component is inserted, which includes the Discord icon and the text \"Discord\".\n- An `onClick` event handler is added to this new menu item, which uses the `window.open` function to open a new browser tab targeting the specified Discord invite link (`https://discord.gg/jdSBAnmdnY`). This action is designated to occur when the user clicks on the Discord link in the drawer.\n\n### HelpDialog Component\n- The `HelpDialog.tsx` file is updated to include the Discord icon, similar to the update in the `Drawer.tsx`.\n- A new clickable icon for Discord is added within a div that contains a `cursor-pointer` class for visual interaction feedback.\n- The same `window.open` method is used here to open the Discord invite link in a new tab when the icon is clicked.\n\n### Code Styling and Consistency\n- The code changes follow the existing style and pattern, ensuring consistency within the codebase.\n- The use of the `window.open` method in both components keeps the behavior uniform across the application.\n\n### User Experience\n- The addition of the Discord link provides users with direct access to join the community or seek support.\n- The presence of the Discord icon in both the drawer and the help dialog ensures that the link is easily accessible from multiple points in the user interface.\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd Context\n\nThe commit message \"[AgentGPT] Daily Iteration (2023.04.10) - \u2b50 Add discord link\" indicates that the changes are part of a daily iteration cycle for the project, dated April 10, 2023.\n\nThe intent of this commit is to enhance community engagement and support by providing users with an easy way to join the project's Discord server. By integrating the Discord link into the application's drawer and help dialog, the development team is fostering a community-centric approach. This addition is likely in response to user feedback or as part of a planned set of features aimed at increasing user interaction and satisfaction.\n\nThe use of the star emoji (\u2b50) in the commit title suggests that the feature is considered a significant or valuable addition to the project. It may also be used to highlight new features in a commit log for easier identification by the team or external contributors reviewing the commit history.",
