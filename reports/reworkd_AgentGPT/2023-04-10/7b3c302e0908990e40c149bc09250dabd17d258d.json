  "content": "## \ud83d\udd0d Technical Highlights\n\nThe commit represents a minor feature enhancement to the user interface of a chat application. Specifically, a system message has been added to the `ChatWindow` component, which is likely to be part of a front-end application built using TypeScript and a library like React.\n\nThe `ChatMessage` component is used to render messages in the chat window. A new `ChatMessage` instance is added, which displays a system-generated notification to users, prompting them to provide their own OpenAI API key through the settings tab. This addition is likely to improve user experience by giving clear instructions on necessary actions to interact with the system, especially if the system depends on the OpenAI API for certain functionalities.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the changes in `ChatWindow.tsx`:\n\n- A new `ChatMessage` component is added to the `ChatWindow` component.\n- The message is of the `system` type, indicating that it's an automated message, not one from another user or agent.\n- The message content is an instruction for the user: \"\ud83d\udce2 Please first provide your own OpenAI API key via the settings tab!\"\n- There is no conditional rendering associated with this message, implying that it will be displayed regardless of the current state or context. However, without additional context or code, it is unclear under which exact conditions this message will be displayed.\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd Context\n\nThe introduction of this system message seems to be aimed at users who are setting up or initializing the chat application for the first time. It implies that the application requires an OpenAI API key to function correctly, which is not uncommon for applications that leverage OpenAI's models for features like chatbots or text analysis.\n\nThis update may have been triggered by user feedback or developer observations that users were not aware they needed to provide their own API keys to use the application fully. By adding this message to the chat window, the developers ensure that users are informed of this requirement early in their interaction with the application, potentially reducing confusion or frustration.\n\nThe presence of a system message type also suggests that the application has a mechanism to display different kinds of messages, such as those from users, agents, or the system itself, which can be useful in guiding the user experience and providing a more interactive and responsive interface.\n\nThis change does not appear to introduce any new dependencies or complex logic, so its impact on the overall codebase should be minimal, mostly affecting user experience and initial setup flow. It seems to be a straightforward enhancement to improve user onboarding and ensure that necessary setup steps are clearly communicated.\n\nThe emoji (\ud83d\udce2) used in the message adds visual attention to the instruction, which may help in drawing the user's attention to this important configuration step. Emojis are often used in user interfaces to convey information in a more engaging and less formal manner, which can be particularly effective in chat interfaces.",
