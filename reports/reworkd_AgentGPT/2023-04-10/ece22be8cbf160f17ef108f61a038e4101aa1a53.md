## üîç Technical Highlights

The commit introduces several changes aimed at making the API key optional for users of the AutonomousAgent component in the application. Here are the key technical highlights of the commit:

1. **Adjusting Loop Limit Based on API Key Presence:**
   In `AutonomousAgent.ts`, the maximum number of loops an agent can perform (`maxLoops`) is now determined by whether a custom API key is provided. If no key is given, the limit is set to 3; otherwise, it is set to 30. This conditional setting is handled by a ternary operator.

2. **Loop Termination Message Update:**
   The message displayed upon reaching the maximum number of loops has been updated to inform users that providing their own API key allows for longer run times.

3. **Settings Dialog Instructions Update:**
   The text in `SettingsDialog.tsx` has been modified to encourage users to use their own OpenAI API key if they want longer execution times, but it also makes it clear that using a key is not mandatory.

4. **Button Disable Condition Update:**
   In `index.tsx`, the condition for disabling the "New Goal" button has been changed to no longer require a custom API key as part of its criteria.

5. **API Key Handling in Model Creation:**
   The `createModel` function in `chain.ts` now applies a default API key fetched from environment variables if a custom key is not provided. This fallback ensures that the system continues to function but with the limitations imposed on the free, default key.

6. **Reducing Default Max Tokens:**
   In the same file, the default maximum number of tokens for the model has been reduced from 500 to 300. This change might be a measure to conserve API usage under the default key or to align with the limitations of the default key.

## üìù Context

The provided changes aim to improve the user experience of the AgentGPT project by enabling users to interact with the platform without the immediate need for a personal OpenAI API key. This makes the platform more accessible to new users or those who are evaluating the software before deciding to commit to obtaining an API key.

By reducing the default max token count and imposing a lower loop limit for users without a custom API key, the application manages resource consumption, which is particularly important for maintaining performance and cost-efficiency when relying on the default (presumably shared) API key.

The updated messages in both the agent shutdown notification and settings dialog are designed to be informative, guiding users towards the option of providing their own key for an enhanced experience, thus balancing user empowerment with resource constraints.
