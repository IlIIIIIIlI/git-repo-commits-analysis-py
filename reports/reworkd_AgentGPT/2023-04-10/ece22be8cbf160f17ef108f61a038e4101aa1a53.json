  "content": "## \ud83d\udd0d Technical Highlights\n\nThe commit introduces changes aimed at handling situations where the user does not provide a custom API key for using AgentGPT. A key focus of this commit is to improve the user experience by making the API key optional and adjusting the system's behavior accordingly.\n\n### Functional Changes:\n\n1. **Adjusting Loop Count Based on API Key Presence:**\n   - The `AutonomousAgent` class now sets a different maximum loop count (`maxLoops`) depending on whether a custom API key is provided. Without a custom API key, the maximum is set to 3 loops; with a key, it is set to 30 loops. This is a practical approach to conserve resources when using the default API key and to provide an extended experience for users with their own keys.\n\n2. **User Messaging for Demos:**\n   - The `sendLoopMessage` method has been updated to include a message informing users that they can have longer runs by providing their own API key in the Settings. This enhances transparency and encourages users to use their own keys for a better experience.\n\n3. **UI Adjustments in Settings Dialog:**\n   - The explanatory text in `SettingsDialog.tsx` has been modified to reflect the new optional nature of the API key and to set expectations about the limitations of runs without a custom key.\n\n4. **Enabling Goal Creation Without API Key:**\n   - In `index.tsx`, the condition for disabling the goal creation button has been changed. Now, the button is enabled as long as an agent does not exist and the required fields (name and goal input) are filled in, regardless of the API key being provided or not.\n\n### Technical Changes:\n\n1. **Environment Fallback for API Key:**\n   - The `createModel` function in `chain.ts` has been modified to use the `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` as a fallback if no custom API key is supplied. This allows the application to continue functioning even if the user does not provide their own key.\n\n2. **Token Limit Adjustment:**\n   - The `maxTokens` parameter in the `createModel` function has been reduced from 500 to 300. This change could be to ensure that each interaction uses fewer resources, which is especially important when operating with the default API key to prevent excessive usage.\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd Context\n\nThis commit seems to be addressing the need to balance resource utilization with user experience. By making the API key optional, the developers are likely trying to lower the entry barrier for users to try out AgentGPT. At the same time, they are implementing measures to control the load on the system, such as reducing the maximum number of loops and the token limit for interactions.\n\nThis change can be seen as a strategic move to attract more users while managing operational costs and ensuring the system remains sustainable in its demo form. It's also an example of a user-centric approach, where users are given the option to enhance their experience by using their own resources (API keys). \n\nFrom a product perspective, this commit might be part of a larger update aimed at making the AgentGPT more accessible and user-friendly, possibly in response to user feedback or analytics indicating that the requirement of an API key was a barrier to entry for some users.",
