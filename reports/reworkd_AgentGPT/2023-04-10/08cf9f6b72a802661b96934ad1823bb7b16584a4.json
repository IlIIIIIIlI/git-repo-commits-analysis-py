  "title": "\u2b50 Allow for a custom API Key",
  "content": "## \ud83d\udd0d Technical Highlights\n\n1. **Custom API Key Support**: The central highlight of this iteration is the introduction of a custom API key feature for the `AutonomousAgent` component. This modification allows users to specify their own API key when creating an instance of the `AutonomousAgent`, which is then used in all API requests. This ensures better customization and flexibility for users to integrate with their preferred API providers or manage their API usage.\n\n2. **API Request Updates**: Correspondingly, all API endpoint handlers (`chain.ts`, `create.ts`, and `execute.ts`) have been updated to accept a `customApiKey` parameter in the request body. The `createModel` function has been introduced to generate a new OpenAI model instance using the custom API key, which is then passed to the respective agent functions (`startGoalAgent`, `executeTaskAgent`, `executeCreateTaskAgent`).\n\n3. **Refactoring and Code Quality Improvements**: The commit includes a refactor where the `isRunning` check has been moved up in the `run` method of `AutonomousAgent.ts` to avoid unnecessary execution when the agent is not running. Additionally, the error message has been updated to provide more clarity and suggest checking the API key as part of troubleshooting.\n\n4. **UI Enhancements**: In `Drawer.tsx`, a new settings icon has been introduced, along with event handlers to manage the visibility of the settings dialog. The `Home` component (`index.tsx`) has been updated to manage the state of the custom API key (`customApiKey`) and to handle the visibility of the help and settings dialogs.\n\n5. **Max Tokens Parameter**: The `createModel` function includes a new parameter `maxTokens` set to `500`, thereby defining a maximum limit for the tokens to be generated by the model in a single response. This could be a move to manage response sizes and ensure consistent performance.\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd Context\n\nThe changes introduced in this commit are part of a larger effort to enhance the flexibility and customization of the `AutonomousAgent`. By allowing users to input their own API keys, developers can now integrate different API services or manage their API quota efficiently. The changes also demonstrate a commitment to refining user experience both through the backend logic and frontend components, ensuring that the application is both robust and user-friendly.\n\nThe addition of a settings dialog in the UI suggests an ongoing development towards more user-centric features, providing end-users with the ability to configure and control application parameters directly from the interface. The technical improvements indicate a thoughtful approach to error handling and preventive checks within the agent's execution flow, which are key to building a resilient and reliable system.\n\nOverall, this commit represents a significant update that not only delivers a new feature but also reinforces the application's architecture and user interface design.",
