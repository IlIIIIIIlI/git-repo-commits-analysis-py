- The `ChatMessage` component is being used to display a system message to the user.
- The content of the message suggests that the user should provide their OpenAI API key through a settings interface.
- The message is decorated with an emoji (üì¢), which is a common practice to attract the user's attention and enhance the user experience by making system messages more friendly and noticeable.
- The implementation follows the existing pattern of including system messages within the `ChatWindow` component.

## üîç Technical Highlights

- This change introduces a user prompt for an OpenAI API key configuration, which is critical for applications that rely on OpenAI services.
- The change is contained within an existing conditionally rendered `Expand` component, suggesting that this message may be part of an initial setup or guidance process within the chat interface.
- The message is hardcoded, which indicates it is a static system message. There is no indication that the message is localized or customizable, which might be a consideration for future development in a multi-language application.
- The addition does not appear to affect existing `ChatMessage` instances, maintaining the integrity of the chat history.

## üìù Context

Given the nature of the message, it seems that this commit was created to guide users through initial configuration steps necessary for the application to function properly. The message prompts the user to provide an OpenAI API key, which suggests that the application integrates with OpenAI's API for some of its core functionality. This change is likely targeted at improving user onboarding by ensuring users are aware of this critical setup step. Additionally, by placing this prompt within the chat interface, it reinforces the interactive and conversational nature of the application.
