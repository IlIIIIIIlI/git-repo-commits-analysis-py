## üîç Technical Highlights

This commit introduces a new feature to an existing application, which appears to be a web-based project. The primary change is the addition of a Discord link in two separate components within the React-based front-end.

### Drawer Component
- The `Drawer.tsx` component has been updated to include a new item for Discord.
- The `FaDiscord` icon from the `react-icons` library is imported and added to the list of icons in the drawer menu.
- A new `DrawerItem` component is inserted, which includes the Discord icon and the text "Discord".
- An `onClick` event handler is added to this new menu item, which uses the `window.open` function to open a new browser tab targeting the specified Discord invite link (`https://discord.gg/jdSBAnmdnY`). This action is designated to occur when the user clicks on the Discord link in the drawer.

### HelpDialog Component
- The `HelpDialog.tsx` file is updated to include the Discord icon, similar to the update in the `Drawer.tsx`.
- A new clickable icon for Discord is added within a div that contains a `cursor-pointer` class for visual interaction feedback.
- The same `window.open` method is used here to open the Discord invite link in a new tab when the icon is clicked.

### Code Styling and Consistency
- The code changes follow the existing style and pattern, ensuring consistency within the codebase.
- The use of the `window.open` method in both components keeps the behavior uniform across the application.

### User Experience
- The addition of the Discord link provides users with direct access to join the community or seek support.
- The presence of the Discord icon in both the drawer and the help dialog ensures that the link is easily accessible from multiple points in the user interface.
