## üîç Technical Highlights

The commit introduces a new feature to the application by adding a Discord link to the user interface. The `Drawer.tsx` file, which likely manages a navigation drawer component, has been updated to include a new `DrawerItem` component with a Discord icon.

Here are the specific changes:

1. A new icon import (`FaDiscord`) has been added to `Drawer.tsx` to display the Discord logo within the navigation drawer.

2. A new `DrawerItem` component has been added to the navigation drawer with the following characteristics:
   - It has the Discord icon from the `react-icons` library.
   - It is labeled "Discord".
   - It contains an `onClick` event handler that uses `window.open` to open the provided Discord invite link (`https://discord.gg/jdSBAnmdnY`) in a new browser tab (`_blank`).

3. The `HelpDialog.tsx` file, which seems to provide a help dialog modal to the user, has also been updated:
   - The `FaDiscord` icon is also imported here.
   - A new clickable icon for Discord has been added to the modal, similar to the existing GitHub and Twitter icons.
   - The Discord icon in the help dialog is also wired to open the same invite link in a new browser tab when clicked.

## üìù Context

The purpose behind this commit appears to be to enhance community engagement by providing users with an easy and accessible way to join the project's Discord server. By adding a Discord link both to the navigation drawer and the help dialog, the developers are encouraging users to become part of their community for discussions, support, and updates.

This addition is likely in response to the increasing importance of community support in software projects, especially in open-source environments where collaboration and communication are key factors for success.

The use of `window.open` to link to external resources is a common practice that enables the application to direct users to web resources without navigating away from the app itself, improving user experience by maintaining application state.

Overall, this commit is straightforward in its implementation but signifies a strategic move to foster a collaborative environment around the application.
