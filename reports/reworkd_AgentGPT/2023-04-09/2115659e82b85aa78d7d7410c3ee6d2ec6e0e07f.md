## üîç Technical Highlights

This commit introduces several key changes aimed at simplifying the environment variable setup and updating the documentation accordingly. The modifications can be broken down into a few primary areas:

1. **Environment Variables Streamlining:**
    - The `.env.example` file, which serves as a blueprint for creating a `.env` file, has been overhauled to remove verbose comments, and the structure has been simplified.
    - The `NODE_ENV` variable is now explicitly set to `development` in the `.env.example` file, indicating the default environment for new clones of the repository.
    - The `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` variables are provided with placeholder values (`changeme`), urging developers to generate their own secrets.
    - The `DATABASE_URL` entry for Prisma remains unchanged, still pointing to a local SQLite database file.

2. **Removal of Discord Provider Configuration:**
    - References to Discord authentication, including `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` and `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`, are removed from the `.env.example`, `README.md`, and `src/env/schema.mjs` files.
    - The `src/server/auth.ts` file has been updated to remove the DiscordProvider import and configuration block, indicating that the application may be moving away from using Discord for authentication or that the implementation is being refactored.

3. **Documentation Updates:**
    - The `README.md` file has been updated to reflect the simplified environment setup and to present the feature set and future plans more concisely.
    - The usage of the `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable has been clarified to use the local development URL by default.

4. **Environment Variables Validation:**
    - A new helper function `requiredForProduction()` has been introduced in `src/env/schema.mjs` to enforce the presence of certain environment variables in production while allowing them to be optional in development and test environments.

5. **Code and Comment Clean-up:**
    - Redundant comments and instructions have been removed throughout the files, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.
    - The format and presentation of content in the `README.md` file have been improved for better readability.

## üìù Context

The changes made in this commit are part of a broader effort to streamline the developer experience when setting up the project and to simplify the configuration process. By removing unnecessary comments and outdated authentication provider configurations, the commit helps reduce potential confusion for new contributors or team members cloning the repository.

The updates also suggest a potential shift in the strategy for user authentication within the application, either by removing the dependency on Discord or by refactoring it for future updates.

The improvements to documentation, including the `README.md`, highlight an ongoing commitment to keep the informational content of the project relevant and user-friendly.

These changes reflect best practices in maintaining a clean and approachable codebase and documentation, which can accelerate development and ease onboarding processes.
