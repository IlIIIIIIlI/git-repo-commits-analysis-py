## üîç Technical Highlights

The latest commit introduces a refinement in the user interface for a button component and updates text labels for action states in a web application. Here are the key technical aspects of the changes:

### Button Component Styling Adjustments
- **File Affected**: `src/components/Button.tsx`
- **Changes Explained**:
  - The padding on the button component has been made responsive to screen size. The original padding of `px-10` applied a fixed horizontal padding to the button, which was likely too wide for smaller screens.
  - The updated version introduces a responsive padding with `sm:px-10`, which means that on screens that match the `sm` (small) breakpoint or larger, the original `px-10` padding will be applied. On screens smaller than the `sm` breakpoint, the padding will be `px-5`.
  - This change ensures that the button looks appropriately sized on both large and small screens, improving the user interface for a wider range of devices.
  
### Text Label Changes for Action States
- **File Affected**: `src/pages/index.tsx`
- **Changes Explained**:
  - Text labels following the loading icons for the "Agent running" and "Stopping agent" states have been simplified to "Running" and "Stopping", respectively.
  - These changes occur within a conditional rendering block, which displays different content based on the state of the application (whether it is running or stopping an agent).
  - The simplification of the text labels might be aimed at making the interface more concise and focused, reducing cognitive load for users by eliminating unnecessary words.

## üìù Context

This commit appears to be part of an ongoing effort to improve the user experience and interface design of a web application. By adjusting the button padding and simplifying text labels, the developers are likely aiming to create a more responsive and streamlined application that is easier to use and understand.

The changes are relatively minor from a functionality standpoint but can have a significant impact on the application's usability, especially when viewed on different devices with varying screen sizes. The consistent use of responsive design principles, such as those applied to the button styling, demonstrates an attention to detail and a commitment to creating a versatile user interface.

The textual changes, while subtle, contribute to a more minimalist and efficient user experience, where the actions and states of the application are communicated clearly without any superfluous language. This can be particularly beneficial for users who prefer or require clear and direct communication, such as those with cognitive disabilities or non-native language speakers. 

Overall, these modifications reflect a thoughtful consideration of design and user experience best practices.
