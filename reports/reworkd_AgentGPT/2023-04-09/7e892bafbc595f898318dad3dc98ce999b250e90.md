## 🔍 Technical Highlights

- **File Affected**: `README.md`
- **Previous State**: The last hyperlink in the HTML content was for contribution guidelines (`🤝 Contribute`).
- **Current Change**: An additional HTML `<span>` element has been added, serving as a visual and spacing separator (containing non-breaking spaces `&nbsp;`) between the existing 'Contribute' link and the new 'Twitter' link.
- **Newly Added**: A hyperlink to a Twitter post is included, represented by the emoji `🐦` and labeled 'Twitter'. The link is formatted as an anchor `<a>` element with an `href` attribute leading to a specific tweet.
- **Purpose of Change**: The goal appears to be to provide readers with a direct link to a relevant Twitter post, possibly related to the project or its updates. This can serve to increase community engagement or to provide additional context through social media.

## 📝 Context

- **Commit Intent**: The purpose of this commit is to enhance the `README.md` file by adding a new point of engagement with the project's audience through a social media platform, in this case, Twitter.
- **Commit Scope**: The change is a minor one and strictly related to documentation, as it only affects the `README.md` file, which is typically used for providing information about the project on platforms like GitHub.
- **Potential Impact**: By linking directly to social media, the project maintainers are likely trying to foster a community or share updates in a more interactive and informal setting. This can be particularly useful for announcements, discussions, and gathering feedback.
- **Considerations**: It is important to ensure that the link provided is permanent and leads to content that will be relevant and appropriate for the readers over time. It's also good practice to make sure the linked Twitter content complies with the project's communication standards and goals.
