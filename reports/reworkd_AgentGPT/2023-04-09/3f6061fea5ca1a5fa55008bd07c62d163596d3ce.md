## üîç Technical Highlights

The commit introduces minor modifications to the application's interface components, specifically targeting social media links. The changes are made in two different files, `Dialog.tsx` and `Drawer.tsx`, which are likely part of the user interface layer of the application. Both components appear to include functionality to open a Twitter link when a certain user interaction occurs, such as clicking a button or icon.

### Analysis of Changes in `Dialog.tsx`:

- The diff indicates a single line change within a JSX (JavaScript XML) block, where the Twitter URL has been updated to point directly to a specific status (or tweet) instead of just the user's Twitter profile.
- The updated URL includes the status identifier `1644883727707959296`, which suggests that the intention behind the update is to direct users to a particular tweet rather than the general profile.
- The change is wrapped in a click event handler, which confirms that this is an interactive element within the dialog component.

### Analysis of Changes in `Drawer.tsx`:

- In `Drawer.tsx`, the change is slightly more extensive, with three lines being added to the existing code.
- The modification follows the same pattern as in `Dialog.tsx`, updating the Twitter link to direct to a specific tweet.
- The new lines of code are formatted to maintain readability and follow best practices for JSX code structure, ensuring that the `window.open` function call is clear and easy to understand.
- The use of `"_blank"` as the second argument to `window.open` ensures that the link will open in a new tab or window, keeping the application open in the current tab.

## üìù Context

Given the nature of these changes, it is likely that the commit is part of an effort to enhance user engagement by directing them to specific content on Twitter, which could be a promotion, announcement, or any relevant update associated with the user's account `asimdotshrestha`.

This might be a strategic update to increase traffic to a particular tweet which could have implications for marketing or social media campaigns. It also suggests a possible feature in the application that promotes recent or important social media activity directly within the user interface.

The changes are straightforward and isolated to external link references, which implies that the potential for introducing bugs is minimal. However, the commit does not include any indication of additional error handling or user feedback mechanisms to address potential issues with opening the new links (e.g., if the user's browser blocks pop-ups or if there is no internet connection).

Overall, the commit appears to be a simple yet targeted update to the application's social media integration, with a specific focus on Twitter engagement.
