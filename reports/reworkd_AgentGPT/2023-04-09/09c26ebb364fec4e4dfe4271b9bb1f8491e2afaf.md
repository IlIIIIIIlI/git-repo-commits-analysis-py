## üîç Technical Highlights

The commit introduces a minor yet relevant update to the project's `README.md` file. The changes can be summarized as follows:

1. **Line Addition**: Two lines have been added to the README, which serve to insert a new hyperlink into the document's HTML-like structure. This hyperlink points to a specific Twitter post.

2. **HTML Structure**: The README.md seems to be using an HTML-like syntax to present information in a structured format. This format is often used to make GitHub repository landing pages more visually appealing and user-friendly.

3. **Link Inclusion**: The added link is presented in the same style as existing links, ensuring consistency in the document's formatting. The addition of non-breaking spaces (`&nbsp;`) and a bullet-point-like character (`‚Ä¢`) is a stylistic choice to separate the links visually.

4. **Contextual Addition**: The link is labeled with a Twitter bird emoji (`üê¶`), which suggests that the content is related to a tweet. This might be used to draw attention to social media discussions, updates, or announcements relevant to the project.

5. **Index Update**: The diff shows an index change from `da58e1f759` to `458ad4ec0a`, indicating that the file has been modified and that the internal tracking index for the file has been updated accordingly.

## üìù Context

Without additional context provided in the commit message, we can infer the following:

- The addition of this Twitter link suggests an intention to highlight certain social media content directly from the README. This could be for promotional purposes, community engagement, or sharing important news related to the project.

- Given that a direct link to a specific tweet has been added, it could be a significant post, perhaps made by a contributor or a figure associated with the project, which the maintainers want to bring to the attention of visitors to the repository.

- The use of a short link to the project and the encouragement to contribute, followed by the Twitter link, points to an active effort to foster a community around the project both on GitHub and on social media platforms.

- The commit message does not specify the reason for the addition of the Twitter link, which could be seen as a lack of detailed documentation. It's generally good practice to explain the motivation behind changes in the commit message for better historical context and clarity for other contributors.

In summary, this commit reflects an effort to use the README file as a central hub for information dissemination and community interaction, leveraging the social media platform Twitter as part of the project's communication strategy.
