## üîç Technical Highlights

This commit introduces a significant functionality to the application by allowing users to manually stop an autonomous agent. The following technical changes have been implemented:

1. **AutonomousAgent Class Updates**:
    - A new `stopAgent` method has been added to the `AutonomousAgent` class. This method changes the `isRunning` state to `false`, indicating that the agent should stop running.
    - A conditional check is added in the agent's main loop (`run` method) to verify the `isRunning` state. If `isRunning` is `false`, it triggers a `sendManualShutdownMessage` followed by a `shutdown` call.
    - The `sendManualShutdownMessage` method is a new addition that sends a system message indicating the manual shutdown of the agent.

2. **Button Component Enhancements**:
    - The `Button` component now accepts an additional optional prop `enabledClassName`. This allows for dynamic styling of the button when it is in an enabled state.
    - The button's className logic has been refactored to include the `enabledClassName` when the button isn't disabled.

3. **User Interface Logic**:
    - A new piece of state `stoppingAgent` has been introduced in the `index.tsx` page to track whether the agent is in the process of being stopped.
    - A new `handleStopAgent` function has been added to manage the stopping of the agent. When invoked, it sets `stoppingAgent` to `true` and calls the `stopAgent` method on the agent instance.
    - The `useEffect` hook is updated to reset `stoppingAgent` to `false` when the agent is set to `null`.

4. **UI Button Addition**:
    - A second button for stopping the agent is conditionally rendered next to the "Deploy Agent" button.
    - This button is disabled when there is no agent instance (`agent == null`), and it changes to show a loading state when `stoppingAgent` is `true`.

## üìù Context

The implementation of a manual shutdown feature addresses the need for user control over the autonomous agent's operation. Prior to this commit, users did not have the ability to interrupt or stop an agent that had been deployed. This update provides an improved user experience by allowing users to stop the agent's process if required.

The changes to the `Button` component enhance its reusability and adaptability across different states and contexts, thus following best practices in component design. The additional UI updates ensure that the user interface reflects the state of the autonomous agent, providing clear feedback to the user regarding the actions that are being taken or can be taken.

Overall, this commit not only adds a new functionality but also demonstrates thoughtful consideration of user interaction by providing visual feedback and maintaining application state accordingly.
