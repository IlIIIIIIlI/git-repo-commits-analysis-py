## üîç Technical Highlights

### Animation Enhancements
The commit introduces visual enhancements in the user interface by adding animation effects to certain elements within the `ChatWindow` and `MacWindowHeader` components.

### `ChatWindow.tsx` Changes:
1. An `Expand` component replaces the `PopIn` component for the initial system message animation, which likely enhances the visual presentation when there are no messages in the chat.
2. The `Expand` component is now configured with a `delay` of 0.8 seconds and the `type` property set to `"spring"`. This implies a spring physics-based animation, which should make the appearance of the initial system message feel more dynamic.

### `MacWindowHeader` Changes:
1. Dots representing the Mac window control buttons (close, minimize, maximize) have been individually wrapped in a `PopIn` component, each with a staggered `delay` (0.4s, 0.5s, 0.6s respectively). This staggered animation adds a playful sequence to the appearance of the control buttons.

### `expand.tsx` Component Enhancements:
1. The `Expand` component receives an additional optional prop `type` to specify the type of animation, with "spring" and "tween" as possible values. This allows for greater flexibility in using `Expand` for different animation effects.
2. The default animation type remains "spring", preserving backward compatibility with existing uses.
3. The `transition` object's properties are modified to accommodate the `type` prop.

### Summary
The commit makes the user interface more engaging through subtle animations. By using React's motion library, the developer creates more lively and responsive interactions. The default values ensure that existing functionality remains unchanged unless explicitly overridden.

## üìù Context

The commit is part of an ongoing effort to improve user experience by enhancing the visual feedback within a chat application interface. By making these elements more dynamic, users may find the application more engaging and intuitive to use. The use of animations is a common practice in modern web design, aiming to improve the perceived performance and responsiveness of an application.

The choice of animation types (spring and tween) suggests attention to detail in how these animations are perceived. Spring animations are known for their natural and physics-based feel, while tween animations offer more controlled, time-based motion. The developer has provided the ability to choose between these types to best suit the context in which the `Expand` component is used.

Overall, this commit reflects a thoughtful approach to enhancing user interaction by incorporating animations that provide both functional and aesthetic improvements to the chat application.
