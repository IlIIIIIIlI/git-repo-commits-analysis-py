## üîç Technical Highlights

The provided diff snippet indicates a change made to the `ChatWindow.tsx` file, which is likely a part of a React application's user interface. The change specifically affects the `ChatMessage` component, which is responsible for rendering individual chat messages within the chat window.

A conditional rendering block has been added to the component that checks if the `message.type` is equal to `"thinking"`. If this condition is true, a new piece of text is displayed to the user:

```jsx
<span className="italic text-zinc-400">
  (Restart if this takes more than 30 seconds)
</span>
```

This text is styled with italic font and a gray color (`text-zinc-400`), consistent with a hint or secondary information. It instructs the user to restart the process if the application remains in a "thinking" state for more than 30 seconds.

Here are the technical details of the changes:

1. **Conditional Rendering**: The use of a conditional statement within the JSX to determine if additional content should be displayed is a standard React pattern. It ensures that the instruction is only shown when relevant, specifically when the application is processing something and potentially taking an unusually long time.

2. **Message Type Check**: The condition `message.type == "thinking"` suggests that the `message` object has a property `type` that indicates the state of the message. When the type is "thinking," it implies that the application is in a processing state.

3. **User Guidance**: The added text acts as a user guidance mechanism. By informing users about expected behavior (in this case, the duration it normally takes to think), it helps manage user expectations and provides a clear action (restart) if the application does not perform as expected.

4. **Styling**: The CSS classes applied to the span ensure the message conforms to the application's design system. The `italic` class suggests an emphasis on the state, and the `text-zinc-400` class applies a specific shade of gray from a likely Tailwind CSS color palette.

5. **User Experience Consideration**: This update implies a concern for user experience, as it attempts to mitigate situations where the user might be left waiting without feedback. Adding this message likely follows user feedback or analytics showing that users are experiencing delays.

6. **Potential for Future Improvement**: While this change is a helpful immediate fix, it also suggests the possibility for future enhancements, such as automatically handling prolonged "thinking" states within the application's logic, rather than requiring manual user intervention.

## üìù Context

The context for this change appears to be a response to an issue where users can experience extended wait times without any indication of what action to take. The application may be processing a request or performing a computation that takes longer than expected, and users are not informed about how long they should wait or what they should do if the application is unresponsive.

This change is a user-interface level mitigation to inform users about potential delays and to give them a proactive measure to resolve the situation themselves. It is a temporary solution that points to the need for handling such cases more gracefully in the future, possibly through backend optimization, better state management, or by introducing a timeout mechanism that automatically restarts or alerts the user.
