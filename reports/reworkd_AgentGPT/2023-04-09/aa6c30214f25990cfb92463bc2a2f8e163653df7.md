## üîç Technical Highlights

The commit introduces the `@vercel/analytics` package to the application, which is a tool provided by Vercel for tracking and analyzing website traffic. The changes are made in three files: `package-lock.json`, `package.json`, and `src/pages/_app.tsx`.

### Modifications in `package.json`:

- `@vercel/analytics` package with version `^0.1.11` is added to the dependencies. This indicates that the minimum version required is `0.1.11`, but it allows for minor updates that do not introduce breaking changes.

### Modifications in `package-lock.json`:

- The lock file is updated with details about the new package, including its version, the resolved URL to the tarball of the package, and the integrity SHA to verify the integrity of the downloaded package.
- A new entry for `node_modules/@vercel/analytics` is created with metadata about the package.
- The `peerDependencies` section under `node_modules/@vercel/analytics` specifies that the package is compatible with React versions `16.8`, `17`, or `18`. This ensures that the analytics package will work correctly with the version of React being used in the project.

### Modifications in `src/pages/_app.tsx`:

- The `Analytics` component from `@vercel/analytics/react` is imported.
- The `Analytics` component is added to the JSX returned by the `MyApp` component. This component is likely responsible for initiating the tracking of page views and other user interactions that are to be logged by the analytics tool.

## üìù Context

The implementation of Vercel analytics will allow the developers to gain insights into the usage patterns of their website. This can be critical for making data-driven decisions to improve user experience and optimize performance.

The decision to add analytics at the `_app.tsx` level suggests an intention to track user interactions across all pages of the application, as `_app.tsx` in Next.js acts as the top-level component that is common across different pages.

Moreover, the integration appears to be a frontend implementation, which means tracking is likely based on client-side events. This can include metrics such as page views, click events, and other user behaviors that happen within the user's browser.

The `@vercel/analytics` package is designed to work seamlessly with Next.js applications hosted on Vercel and provides a simple way to integrate analytics into a React application. It is important to note that any analytics integration should respect user privacy and comply with regulations such as GDPR or CCPA. Therefore, the analytics setup might also include consent management or anonymization features, although this is not explicitly shown in the provided code diff.
